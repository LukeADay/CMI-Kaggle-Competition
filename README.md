# Child Mind Institute â€” Problematic Internet Use

## Overview
Can you predict the level of problematic internet usage exhibited by children and adolescents, based on their physical activity? The goal of this competition is to develop a predictive model that analyzes children's physical activity and fitness data to identify early signs of problematic internet use. Identifying these patterns can help trigger interventions to encourage healthier digital habits.
